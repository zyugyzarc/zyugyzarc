## Projects
##### TraiNNer - Neural Network Designer | Pytorch, QT, Dataflow
- Designed and developed an interactive Python application to design neural networks.
- Implemented the runtimes various neural network components and layers.
- Developed visualization for network weights and code-flow for better model and program intuition.

##### Eddie - Reinforcement Learning Robot | Reinforcement Learning, Pytorch, Godot, Raspberri Pi
- Built a 2-wheeled robot, and then used reinforcement learning and SLAM to pathfind around an environment.
- Trained the RL-Agent in a simulation built with Godot and Blender, and then fine-tuned it in the real word.
- Implemented and tested various RL methods, including PPO, SAC, and I2A.

##### Hot Potato - Multiplayer Game | WebRTC, Decentralized Networks, Redis, React
- Developed a Decentralized P2P game using a custom protocol built on top of WebRTC.
- Created a custom React-like UI framework to support stateful interactions with zero dependencies.
- Deployed and Used redis for client-to-client handshakes, following a pub-sub architecture.

##### MiniGPT - Implementation of an SLM | Multihead Attention, Transformer Language Models, Pytorch
- Implemented a Small language model with Multihead Attention, and trained it on the Shakespeare text corpus.
- Optimized the model for the best set of hyperparameters.

##### Blocksim - Hardware Accelerated Physics Engine | Vulkan, GPGPU, GLSL, GLFW, C++
- Designed and Built a 2D Hardware Accelerated Physics Engine with the Vulkan C API.
- Parallelized the base physics engine with Compute shaders for framerates upto âˆ¼ 5000 FPS.
- Implemented a mix of KD-trees and Spacial subdivision for high volume (100,000-s of objects) collision resolution.

##### Ascii Render - 3D Graphics Engine | Python, C++, Curses, Linear Algebra
- Designed and Developed a 3D raster graphics engine that runs on a terminal console.
- Used tools like curses and ansi codes to interface with the terminal to support graphics.
- Implemented the core features of a graphics pipeline, such as Vertex projection, Z-Buffering, Texture interpolation,
Transform Object Models, Material Systems, Per-vertex attributes, Instancing and more.
- Built a high-speed and light core (in C++) while still being easy-to-use through a Python interface.
