# Projects

#### [Hot Potato](https://github.com/zyugyzarc/hot-potato)

  * Built a custom react-inspired Javascript UI-Framework from scratch (no dependencies) with Object Oriented Programming, for a seamless user experience ([Demo Project](https://github.com/zyugyzarc/quizzerole?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-framework))
  * Made a decentralized state management system with low latency, by building a peer-to-peer realtime mesh network, using WebRTC.
  * Used the Custom UI-Framework and the State Management System to build a fun multiplayer party game.
