  * Skills: PyTorch, QT5, Process Visualization, Graph DataStructures.

#### [Hot Potato](https://github.com/zyugyzarc/hot-potato) - 2D Multiplayer Game
  
  * Skills: WebRTC, p2p networks, Redis (Vercel), Javascript, HTML/DOM
  * Built a custom react-inspired Javascript UI-Framework from scratch (no dependencies) with Object Oriented Programming, for a seamless user experience ([Demo Project](https://github.com/zyugyzarc/quizzerole?tab=readme-ov-file#about-the-framework))
  * Made a decentralized state management system with low latency, by building a peer-to-peer realtime mesh network, using WebRTC.
  * Used the Custom UI-Framework and the State Management System to build a fun multiplayer party game.

#### Vulkanized - 2D Physics Engine
  
  * Skills: Vulkan, C++, Memory Management, Parallelism and Synchronization
  * A C++ style wrapper around vulkan, used to make a 2D physics engine using compute shaders and parallelization.
  * A Study on Graphics APIs, GPGPU and interaction/simulation models.

#### [Ascii-Render](https://github.com/zyugyzarc/ascii-render) - 3D Graphics Engine

  * a 3D raster engine - rendering 3D models with shading and textures in realtime, onto a terminal/shell using ascii-art ([screenshots](https://github.com/zyugyzarc/ascii-render)).
  * A study on Graphics Processing, Shader Programming and Mathematical Models of 3D Objects.
  * Skills: Linear Algebra, Trigonometry, C++, Python, Linux/Bash/Shell
